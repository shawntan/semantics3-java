# semantics3
semantics3-java is a Java client for accessing the Semantics3 Products API, which provides structured information, including pricing histories, for a large number of products.
See https://www.semantics3.com for more information.

## Requirements
* [signpost-core-1.2.1.2.jar](https://oauth-signpost.googlecode.com/files/signpost-core-1.2.1.2.jar) - OAuth2 implementation
  
* [commons-codec-1.7.jar](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-codec/commons-codec/1.7/commons-codec-1.7.jar) - Apache Commons Codec library for Base64 implementation

## Getting Started

In order to use the client, you must have both an API key and an API secret. To obtain your key and secret, you need to first create an account at
https://www.semantics3.com/
You can access your API access credentials from the user dashboard at https://www.semantics3.com/dashboard/applications

### Running unit tests
add a file in src/test/resources/credentials.properties. Replace with a valid api key.
```java
apiKey: SEM3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
apiSecret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
### Installing locally 
mvn clean install

### Setup Work

Add this to your pom
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.semantics3</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Let's lay the groundwork.

```java
import com.semantics3.api.impl.DefaultSemantics3Factory;
import com.semantics3.api.model.ProductResponse;
import com.semantics3.api.Semantics3;
import com.semantics3.api.ProductUrl;

DefaultSemantics3Factory factory = new DefaultSemantics3Factory(
  "SEM3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", 
  "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
);
Semantics3 semantics3 = factory.create();

```

### First Query aka 'Hello World':

Let's make our first query! For this query, we are going to search for all Toshiba products that fall under the category of "Computers and Accessories", whose cat_id is 4992. 

```java
/* Build the query */
ProductUrl url
            .filter(Product.CAT_ID, 4992)
            .filter(Product.BRAND, "Toshiba");
ProductResponse response = semantics3.query(url, ProductResponse.class);

// Iterate through the responses.
```

### Unit Test your searches ###
```java
  @Test
  public void categoryAndBrand() {
    final String expected = "https://api.semantics3.com/v1/products?q={\"cat_id\":4992,\"brand\":\"Toshiba\"}";
    url
            .filter(Product.CAT_ID, 4992)
            .filter(Product.BRAND, "Toshiba");
    assertUrl(expected);
  }  
```

## Examples

The following examples show you how to interface with some of the core functionality of the Semantics3 Products API. For more detailed examples check out the Quickstart guide: https://www.semantics3.com/quickstart

### Explore the Category Tree

In this example we are going to be accessing the categories endpoint. We are going to be specifically exploiring the "Computers and Accessories" category, which has a cat_id of 4992. For more details regarding our category tree and associated cat_ids check out our API docs at https://www.semantics3.com/docs

```java
CategoryUrl url = new CategoryUrl();
url.filter(Category.CAT_ID, 4992);
CategoryResponse response = semantics3.query(url, CategoryResponse.class);
//Iterate the response
```

### Nested Search Query

You can intuitively construct all your complex queries but just repeatedly using the products_field() or add() methods.
Here is how we translate the following JSON query:

```javascript
{
	"cat_id" : 4992, 
	"brand"  : "Toshiba",
	"weight" : { "gte":1000000, "lt":1500000 },
	"sitedetails" : {
		"name" : "newegg.com",
		"latestoffers" : {
			"currency": "USD",
			"price"   : { "gte" : 100 } 
		}
	}
}
```


This query returns all Toshiba products within a certain weight range narrowed down to just those that retailed recently on newegg.com for >= USD 100.

```java
/* Build the query */
Products products = new Products( api_key, api_secret );
products
	.field("cat_id", 4992)
	.field("brand", "Toshiba")
	.field("weight", "gte", 1000000)
	.field("weight", "lt", 1500000)
	.siteDetails("name","newegg.com")
	.latestOffers("currency","USD")
	.latestOffers("price","gte",100);
	
/* Let's make a modification - say we no longer want the weight attribute */
products.remove( "products", "weight" );

/* Make the query */
JSONObject results = products.getProducts();
System.out.println(results);
```


### Explore Price Histories
For this example, we are going to look at a particular product that is sold by select merchants and has a price of >= USD 30 and seen after a specific date (specified as a UNIX timestamp).

```java
/* Build the query */
products.offersField("sem3_id", "4znupRCkN6w2Q4Ke4s6sUC");
products.offersField("seller", new String[] { "LFleurs","Frys","Walmart" });
products.offersField("currency", "USD");
products.offersField("price", "gte", 30);
products.offersField("lastrecorded_at", "gte", 1348654600);

/* Make the query */
JSONObject results = products.getOffers()

/* View the results of the query */
System.out.println(results)
```
